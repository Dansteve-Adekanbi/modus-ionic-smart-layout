## What is a Progressive Web App?

Put simply, a Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. These apps are deployed to traditional web servers, are accessible through URLs, and can be indexed by search engines.

A Progressive Web App is, for all practical purposes, just another term for a website that has been optimized for mobile performance and that utilizes newly available Web APIs to deliver features that are similar to a traditional native app, such as push notifications and offline storage.

## Set to creating ionic PWA

I would have loved to create a step-by-step here, but. We don't have to reinvent the will  :smile:.
